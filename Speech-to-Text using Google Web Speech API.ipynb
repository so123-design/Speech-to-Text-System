    "## **Introduction**\n",
    "This project demonstrates a **Speech-to-Text Application** that converts spoken words into text using a microphone. The application leverages the **Google Web Speech API** for high-accuracy transcription. The program is designed to be user-friendly and adaptive to environmental noise, making it suitable for various real-world use cases.\n",

    "- **Ambient Noise Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts to background noise for improved recognition accuracy.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Energy Threshold**: Adapts dynamically to the audio environment.\n",
    "- **Customizable Language Support**: Configured to recognize French (`fr-FR`) with support for other languages as needed.\n",
    "- **Timeout Settings**: Ensures responsiveness by limiting listening time and handling speech silence effectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1. Speech Recognition Setup**\n",
    "The system initializes the `speech_recognition.Recognizer` object, which handles audio capture and processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "recognizer = sr.Recognizer()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Microphone Input Handling**\n",
    "The microphone is used as the audio source. The program accounts for ambient noise and adjusts the sensitivity of the recognizer accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with sr.Microphone() as source:\n",
    "    print(\"Adjusting for ambient noise, please wait...\")\n",
    "    recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source, duration=2)\n",

    "### **3. Speech Processing**\n",
    "The program listens for audio input with a timeout and transcribes it using the Google Web Speech API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Timeout**: Limits the duration of listening to 10 seconds.\n",
    "- **Pause Threshold**: Determines how long the system waits for silence before assuming the speech is complete.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Energy Threshold**: Adjusts sensitivity to varying noise levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "The program is robust against common errors such as:\n",
    "- **No Speech Detected**: Alerts the user when no speech is captured within the timeout limit.\n",
    "- **Recognition Failure**: Handles cases where the speech is unclear or unintelligible.\n",
