# Speech-to-Text-System

### Speech-to-Text using Google Web Speech API
This project demonstrates a Speech-to-Text Application that converts spoken words into text using a microphone. The application leverages the Google Web Speech API for high-accuracy transcription. The program is designed to be user-friendly and adaptive to environmental noise, making it suitable for various real-world use cases.

### Speech Command Recognition Using Deep Learning
This project implements a Speech Command Recognition system using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). The system processes raw audio waveforms, converts them into mel spectrograms, and classifies them into predefined speech command categories. The project utilizes TensorFlow and Librosa libraries and is trained on the Google Speech Commands Dataset.
